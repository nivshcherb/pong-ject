<img src="https://media.tenor.com/2gyJVMt_L6wAAAAC/pong-video-game.gif" alt="pong"/>

> Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other. [*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)

# Objectives

In this project we will write a simple Pong game that runs on ubuntu terminal.
While some of the implementation might be considered outdated, the goal is to build a working game in way that will allow improvements later on if you chose to do so.

Some sub-goals are:
1. Following the SOLID principles, even in a simple project.
2. Writing a visual project without needing non-standart libraries.
3. Understanding the basics of game building and gameloop.
3. Reading Linux device files.
4. Understanding TCP/UDP, use cases and actual usage.
5. Having fun. :)

[doc/](doc/) includes the instructions and can be followed each at a time.

[Pong/](Pong/) includes an example of the complete project for reference.

This project is writen in **C++**.
